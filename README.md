Added a Contact page and About Page with Validation
Moved from a single card into multi-page applications. This stage, I created two new pages â€” a Contact Us page with form validation, and an About Me page where I share my reflections. As always, semantic HTML, accessibility, responsiveness, and data-testid attributes are key.
